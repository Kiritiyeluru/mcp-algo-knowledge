# Implementation Guides

This directory contains detailed implementation guides that supplement the knowledge maps with concrete examples, patterns, and specifics needed for thorough implementations.

While the knowledge maps provide the structure and interfaces, these guides provide:

1. **Concrete Examples**: Real code examples for fixtures, tests, and components
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Specific approaches for handling edge cases
3. **Market-Specific Details**: Indian market implementation specifics
4. **Common Patterns**: Example implementations of common patterns

## Available Guides

- [Position Tracking Test Fixtures](position_tracking_fixtures.md) - Detailed guide for implementing position tracking test fixtures
- [Mock Implementation Patterns](mock_implementation_patterns.md) - Guide for creating effective mock implementations
- [Indian Market Validation](indian_market_validation.md) - Specific validation rules for Indian market trading

## Using These Guides

When implementing a component, first refer to the:
1. Component knowledge map for the structure and interfaces
2. Common patterns for project-wide standards
3. These implementation guides for concrete examples and specific details

This approach ensures you have all the necessary details for a thorough implementation without missing critical aspects.
